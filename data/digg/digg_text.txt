hi mowe br br i do have a few questions i understand that in islam you must believe in all that is taught by the prophet and cannot disagree lest you are no longer a muslim is that correct br br if so how do you feel about the duty of the husband to discipline his wife via physical beatings br br how do you feel about the doctrine that explains it is ok for a man to have several wives and for the marriage of little girls of and years to middle aged men a few weeks back a judge refused to annul a marriage in saudi arabia when the mother pleaded for her year old girl who was married off to the fathers year old friend as repayment for a debt br br how do you feel about the fact that your testimony is worth half that of a man s br br how do you feel about muhammad s doctrine that allows for temporary marriages in order to allow his soldiers to have sex with women and then leave them with no rights after the temporary marriage is over mind you this still goes on in certain muslim countries br br these are just a few examples of what i view as unreasonable demands of islam br br i ca n t answer your question as to why people convert to islam people convert to scientology as well even though so many consider it a dangerous cult br br i have however heard too many stories of those who left islam especially women and their stories of abuse and subjugation are horrific br br

this story is n t about marijuana even if its legalized swat teams will continue to execute no knock warrants when going after cocaine ecstasy heroin meth pcp etc and continue to abuse their power and authority the way they did here if that box had contained a kilo of cocaine and the owner of the house was n t the mayor of the town but just some random citizen unlucky enough to have their address picked by the drug dealers as a drop then you d probably never hear this story the cops would just lie like they apparently did both in getting the warrant it was n t a no knock warrant and trying to cover up after the fact claiming the man opened the door then slammed it in the cops face that the dogs were threatening the cops etc br br legalizing marijuana wo n t stop this abuse by the police it ll just remove one of the many reasons they have to abuse their power power

as title suggests it is several missing links of a very big very disturbing puzzle the links usually not discussed as acceptable truths links conveniently left out of other documentaries cia do n t think so the rabbit hole goes much deeper than single film could ever be capable of missing links highlights several culprits behind the curtain hidden safely in shadows of this fraud of the century br br pnac is the cornerstone to just ask sibel edmonds ashcroft invoked the state secrets privilege on her to silence her completely and prevent her from revealing the truth of their crime networks and weapons arms trading profiteer deals they are afraid of her speaking in a court of law under oath of what she knows of this cover up what have they got to hide why such intense secrecy is this how an innocent party acts is a trans national scandal that would embarrass far too many important people br br any wonder why this pnac think tank group and their new pearl harbor to put our major theater war manifesto in motion coincidence was never investigated questioned held to account probed much less mentioned or analyzed in the slightest by the usual paid for talking pundits on controlled fake news networks to speak of

i would have to say i m torn on the issue on one hand i like the idea of having work to do here in the us i like money i like having a job and when people buy from my company an american one i get to keep my job i know there s all sorts of talk from people about how oh protectionism does n t work reality is if my company does n t make money they lay off tons of people which they have done and continue to do br br there should be incentive to keeping jobs in the us and it should n t come at just a monetary price tag unfortunately it s all about the money and if there s no money to be made here then there s no reason to have companies here br br we have nothing to export we do n t have tons of cheap labor we ca n t survive on day like they can in some of these nations we ve built regulations into our system to protect our workers and our consumers we ca n t just go throwing lead paint into toys and poisons into toothpaste to reduce the cost of production br br unfortunately as a result of this and the result of the ability to communicate and travel to far off nations there s no incentive at all to have jobs here when you can make significantly more money doing it elsewhere br br so yes i believe we need some way to enforce some minor protectionism in our economy i m not saying cut off completely import and export or anything of that nature but i m saying there needs to be incentive to stay focused on our country there s nothing wrong with this most other countries have a protectionist policy when it comes to their workforce and it works out very well for them

incorrect br br the evidence that suggests peds make a pitcher throw harder is substantially weak the sentence you re responding to chemically enhanced pitches was a figure of speech peds help pitchers reduce fatigue as the season wears on thus making them more effective in the later months than they otherwise would be example ryan franklin he had a career year where he was able to throw innings of quality pitching despite zero enhancement to his stuff was busted in and has since found starting significantly more difficult and has been relegated to a relief role br br velocity induces vastly more swinging strikes than it does turning ordinary flyballs into home runs if anything a fastball with more zip on it because of peds would hurt barry more often that it would help him as it would all hitters br br this sentence may be factually correct but the insinuation behind it is wrong

while these are all good points if it is n t a project designed to be begun and completed in the short term then it is n t economic stimulus that would be regular infrastructure building and such spending should be considered in other normal budgetary spending matters the argument that this is our big chance to get a huge chunk of money does n t fly we should not be any less critical of the spending in the stimulus package than we would be spending in the federal budget

thats the point br i am so happy to have the president stand up for the real world a stimulus is spending you can spend it on good things that create jobs or stupid things like simple rebate checks that do n t that is a good debate but republican lawmakers do n t believe this simple fact and voted to remove all spending and replace it with huge tax cuts for rich individuals where is the middle ground with that that

actually in this time of economic hardship it is good for the country to have a leader to look up to obama s mere presence in office is restoring american faith in the economy and will help to make things better he is not an over night cure but he does a good job of giving us the faith in america we need right now br br btw as an obama supporter i would be behind mccain had he won because we need a leader at this time in history and anyone willing to do the job deserves respect and admiration admiration

the wording of stimulus bill says that government bailout money cannot be used for churches it does not ban religious worship br br the wording of the bill said nothing of the kind i suggest you actually read the text of those couple of lines that demint was questioning in context with the entire section of the american recovery and reinvestment act br br priority funding is given to higher education facilities that have been included in a declared emergency all the funds are administered through the state departments of higher education and distributed in proportion to the number of students at each school br br all schools receiving grants have to commit to spending percent of the grant to projects that are certifiable under green building standards such as the leed green building system etc br br the grants are to be used for a wide variety of renovations and improvements that are primarily used for instruction research or student housing br br except br br a the maintenance of systems equipment or facilities including maintenance associated with any permissible uses of funds described in paragraph br br b modernization renovation or repair of stadiums or other facilities primarily used for athletic contests or exhibitions or other events for which admission is charged to the general public br br c modernization renovation or repair of facilities br br i used for sectarian instruction religious worship or a school or department of divinity or br br ii in which a substantial portion of the functions of the facilities are subsumed in a religious mission or br br d construction of new facilities br br br so while the money can be used for projects in facilities that are primarily used for instruction if the facility is primarily used for instruction in religion such as a school of divinity then the grant money cannot be used to renovate or improve that facility at least percent of the grant money has to be spent on green building projects br br i m not certain if that bit in the bill is discriminatory though it seems likely as the wording is vague how much usage is substantial the government withholds money that would be granted for improvements to facilities used for any other type of instruction br br not exactly equal treatment under the eyes of the lawmakers br br demint appears to have been grandstanding with his proposed amendment br br to allow the free exercise of religion at institutions of higher education that receive funding under section of division a br br that said i think the entire bill is a travesty as you do n t get out of debt by digging ever deeper into your creditor s pockets br br the complete text of the bill br

while i disagree with ending the death penalty entirely i certainly see a need to make it harder to impose i have thought for a long time that we need a higher standard of proof than the beyond a reasonable doubt convictions we have right now it is an overused word but there are some jackals out there that are truly deserving of the word monster and when those deserving few are caught and scientifically proven to be guilty our world is better off with them dead br br would it help to have a full review the case after a conviction but before the sentencing make sure the conduct of the police was completely above board the prosecutors actually turned over all evidence as required the defense was competent the judge had no conflict of interest or political agenda and all the forensic tests were done by certified techs on properly calibrated equipment etc the conduct of all involved needs to be examined and if it is n t completely above reproach then the death penalty is off the table and life without parole becomes the maximum sentence

my heart hurts for this family i feel for both partners and their children we live in ca and in a non religious hospital i was very disappointed when hospital staff refused to answer my questions as to my partner s emergency room visit which was under circumstances much less severe than what happened to the family in this article the lgbt community faces so much discrimination and lack of respect in so many ways the fact that this family did all they legally could had all the right paperwork not to mention the legal expenses that go along with all of that not to mention years of life shared together and still their was no regard for their relationship and the fact that they were a family by hospital staff when one of them was dying scares the shit out of me the doma laws need to be repealed i think the involved hospital staff and the heads of the hospital should all have to go through diversity sensitivity classes and i hope the hospital looses this case and has to pay the family an exorbitant amount of money sometimes the pocketbook is the best place to hit in order for such lessons to be learned learned

misleading perhaps but do n t judge the speaker harshly it s rather difficult to explain it succinctly and accurately to the layman let me give it a shot br br the fact is all our best descriptions of the universe treat time and space on a very similar footing you may choose not to call time a dimension words are just words so that s your perogative but in fact time is something very similar to a dimension and in the mathematical sense of the word it certainly qualifies br br in fact the basic difference is time has a minus sign in a couple of key equations while the three space dimensions each have a plus sign well the other difference is it s measured in years instead of meters but that problem s solvable one light year is fundamentally one year of distance that s why physicists use light years br br now it s true that minus sign makes time a very different beast from space but in a mathematical sense it s still a dimension and spacetime is a four dimensional manifold of some strange structure we do n t know everything about yet

enough with the hate mongering anything that panders to a stereotype is not hate speech yes women have pms yes men double up if they get kicked in the balls neither observation is hateful br br most of these commercials would work well enough with a man boy as the protagonist too they are not sexist just implying their customers are dumb i remember a commercial where a man was apparently too dumb to work a water filter and the woman showed him how smugly that is sexist but apparently there is only outcry if the roles are reversed of course it would be sexist the other way round too br br and of course i concede the polyglas tire one is completely sexist and demeaning but how old does that have to be years or more
found this pretty interesting br br male bashing in tv br br just shows how a lot of comedies sitcoms have a male lead who is an idiot poor parent etc and how in between the commercials have an anti man vibe to em br br thought it was interesting to go against the tv hates women vein

net should be ditched and mono should rise meaning c people should code toward mono and not net in term what this will do is force microsoft out of ownership of the c coding language then by c having no owner it can become as standard as c or c that in terms will help developers and all users br br i admit i had a problem against c because the fact net closed and propetiary is the main implementation of it though with an open implementation combo of c gtk qt its called something else i noticed this is actually a good thing except for the fact mono is trying ot be a clone of net and not try to surpass it that is an issue br br basically what i want to see happen with mono is that it integrates functions and parts from all over into it basically anyone who builds extentions to mono c do n t hesitate to begin integrating these things in the mainline design br br so pretty much if mono continues to be brain dead step child of net then i ca n t truly support c but if people force mono as the c standard then its well worth it

obama stated many times on his campaign that he wanted to give more funding to churches and to empower them to help to their communities i do n t know why anybody is surprised by this move did you actually listen to what obama was saying and read about his policy during the campaign or just buy into the ultra left wing image that the media and republicans painted of him br br also despite what you may think most churces are not the rabid evangelical type and do a lot of good for their communities especially in inner cities obama made his early political career as a community organizer working alongside churches this is exactly in line with his character

the current beer tax in oregon according to the story i saw on the news said the current tax is less than one cent per pint while i d say as an oregonian and a beer drinker this is too minimal and i would support a tax increase we have such a budget shortfall here they re talking about closing all the public schools in april because we ca n t afford to keep em open an jump is n t a reasonable amount in my book br br it should be stated for the record that a barrel of beer equals two kegs so a tax per barrel works out to per gallon keg or about cents per pint at a bar br br of course area brewers here are claiming it s going to raise the cost of a pint by which is ridiculous

it was the individual who believed the cat felt there was something wrong and you re debating on the cats knowledge now if you re really paying attention you ll put together a few things notice that it is mentioned the cancer was in an early stage and could have gone undetected for five or more months the cats behavior must have seemed random or spontaneous to the individual hence his concern being triggered by an event which was n t normal you can very reasonably assume that cat may have sensed a difference in the owners state from one point in time to another the cat does n t need to think there s something wrong i m sure if the cats senses were capable of detecting oder from the cancer then it was simply recognizing and curious about a change nothing more br br the question of good or bad is irrelevant it s people who determine that subjectively well all animals eventually learn it hence being able to avoid danger it could be just a coincidence albeit an incredible one the cats behavior was apparantly as recently odd as the cancer within this individuals lungs br br it s possible this is a coincidence and evidence from research suggests it may not be i m not going to make a decision either way i ll just appreciate the new information i ve been able to consume and learn more about it in time br br the important question is could the cat have detected the cancer where on the body the cat was scratching is the only place i see the greatest possibility for coincidence the detection of the cancer itself may very well have been real and without the need for the cat to believe it was a bad thing br br imho

it s time to stop playing the blame game what bush has done might have been bad but i honestly believe in obama s message of bipartisanship and understanding everything we do should be for the state and a case against bush would divide the country in twain yes i just wanted to say twain a case like that would make it difficult for any republicans who answer to their constituency to work on economic packages with democrats br br i do n t think it s fair to let bush off the hook but right now his crimes are less important than saving our economy soldiers and rights

i have deep concerns as much as we need speed to fix the policies which authorized the many abuses of civil liberties the decisions need to be tempered with an aim to the future to prevent these abuses from happening again having said that the president has made some decisions which are clearly contrary to the goal of restoring all civil liberties eliminating the poisonous policies and protecting us in the future br br i intend to continue to read about his decisions and if they do not show a clear direction toward restoration of our civil liberties very soon i am likely to be marching in the streets with the radicals br br and after reading the testimony of spc brandon neely and realizing that we still have people who have been in those cages see the picture in the following for or years every day counts br this is not just a national embarrassment it becomes a crime to which all of us are a party if we do not take steps to urge our elected officials to take action and to open investigations and prosecutions

the assertion that some of the spending in the bill is n t stimulus br media matters thinks that anytime the government spends money on anything that stimulates the economy in economics this is called the fallacy of the broken windows the idea that if a store gets it s windows broken and has to fix them this stimulates the economy br br not true the storeowner has to spend money but if not for the broken window he could have spent that money on something else br br does media matters believe the government should pay people to dig holes and then fill them in imagine how many people that would put to work of course that s silly but in the same way we believe and fox news explains that spending on useless projects is not stimulative br br government spending projects did n t work in the s did n t work in japan in the s never worked in the now defunct soviet union it s really never worked and it s crazy to gamble everything we have on the chance that the very first time in history that it will work would be now
libs always emotional always race baiting an idiot is someone who voted for and signed a bill that nobody even read the dems love to bypass the normal procedures to push their liberal agendas by back handed tactics like this or putting activist justices on the bench they hate to have things like the things written into this pork stimulus bill actually go through the proper legislative process so we all would see what is being proposed and debated then voted on br br they insult the constitution and every american even if they had to find new people to write the bill it would be the same bs by the same extreme radical leftost partisan democrats too bad i left the party because of the leftist marxists who are in charge now they all are embarrassments to the party and the country sharpton is one of the biggest embarrassment the american people made a big mistake on election day and maybe now they will be finding out the truth and buyers remorse will set in in

it s a compromise it minimizes the loss does n t negate it if the plan was to compensate mortgage companies to for the full amount that they would have made off of the shady loan we d have to set up a few more printing presses to print all the money needed br br from my understanding there are many banks amp mortgage lenders who would like to renegotiate the terms but are not being allowed to by the holding company that backs up the loan this program allows the bank or mortgage company to turn the loan completely over to fannie mae amp freddie mac for the cost of the holding company is the big loser here but they are the ones who established the rules that got is in this trouble in the first place

just what the world needs another nuclear arms race thing is what seems to be complicating matters is that so many countries can claim they are merely developing alternative energy sources because of the dwindling fossil fuel supply but nuclear is so expensive and potentially very dangerous remember chernobyl and three mile island because of the efforts made by big oil over the past years solar power has never been seriously considered although it certainly deserves to be along with wind technology br br the most worrisome factor in this whole mess is the fear that is being deliberately spread by the media and by the government we have to stop this war machine and not just drink the noxious kool aid being served up on this issue issue

i think the address range of ipv is the least of our problems that can be solved by moving to ipv br the bigger problem is going to be domain name lookup dns and having a human readable name for all those addresses already the word like combinations for domains are pretty much exhausted and strange words appear eg digg com br assume every device has a unique ipv address on the internet how are you going to remember the address of your home computer for example it will be something like df ebc c a b c eb d a d c when most people are lucky to remember their home phone number mypc streetaddress mytown com would be memorable and unique but who wants to give away that information on the net br dns is global so lookups based on unique factors like your name wo n t work there s most likely a thousand other who shares the same name as you the internet is going to need a better directory service br br

rafikichi the dollar is not in the equation i realize that dollars pounds yen are just pieces of paper whose values can be bubbles or like the american dollar probably soon will rapidly devalue br br gold silver are like currency in many ways though they do have the advantage that since it is difficult to print gold the market is n t likely to get flooded with gold but many minerals and stones share this characteristic what makes gold so special it s all in our heads just like every other bubble br br land is even more difficult to print than gold it grows more scarce with increases in population houses often come with land and represent a significant amount of labor if one owns a home with a value of x they will enjoy far more benifits than a person who owns a sum of gold with an equal value the housing bubble was dumb but not as dumb as the gold bubble br br i m not saying buying gold is necessarily stupid you can get very rich off of bubbles as many did with housing just be aware that they pop br br also wealth is destroyed depreciation vandalism consumption eg food and reduction in number of services provided all destroy wealth i believe what you are getting at is that wealth does n t instantly evaporate unless icbms are launched it is important to be aware that these factors do erase wealth because as a recession or depression wears on they will force some gold owners to cash in their investment to replace other assets this will cause gold to start consistently losing value this will cause a loss of confidence in the bubble then it will pop

it sounds like in ms krause s case they wo n t make any money maybe they thought it would be a big bust and worth the money i dunno br br in a drug bust the property of the one busted or unclaimed property found at the site or even the land itself can be forfeit it depends on a million things but the basics are if there s a criminal conviction in drugs then it opens up the money game this may only be with felonies which may go toward ms krause s words about the sheriff expecting plants instead of her br br anyway assuming many things br bust somebody and later there s a conviction br the county then sues the new felon in civil court using the criminal conviction as evidence br based on that evidence the county gets the land the car found there etc br br it s very big money while drug cases have special provisions to make it easier for the government to get the goods it can also apply to other crimes such as if somebody robs a bank the county can sue to get the car that was used in the crime otherwise the car would should be returned after the case is over even if the person is convicted br br for drug cases many times law enforcement is able to find a boatload of cash not for ms krause s plants but if they find a briefcase full of money the county sues gets the cash and then they buy more ambulances firetrucks police cars oak desks for the city counsel etc br

it s one thing to copy minor or common features not available for macintosh browsers i m fine with that br br the problem is when apple rips off a feature and pretends they are the ones who thought of it in the first place on the feature list they claim they are the first browser to pass acid compliance no they are using the webkit engine which passed on the same day that opera s engine passed as well they say they are the first browser able to integrate with rss feeds actually opera and firefox both have been utilizing rss technology long before safari implemented that feature br br those are only several examples of their hubris but there s about a dozen more of these white lies spread throughout their marketing i m ok with feature copying as a form of flattery but apple has a bad habit of misrepresenting the facts to make it look like they were the innnovators when in actuality they are just pissing on the shoulders of giants

what part does n t make sense i do have some microbiology classes under my belt do you br br bacteria of all sorts are not good for you in certain doses good bacteria can run a muck and cause disease too we call them good bacteria because they are naturally part of the fauna of our bodies and in normal numbers they contributes to our health when their numbers are too great they cause disease whole milk spoils as well br br outside of the environment they are acclimatized to adapted to the bovine body those bacteria will likely not do as well giving room for other bacteria to grow many bacteria will be introduced at all levels of industrial handling and if those bacteria grow faster than the natural bovine fauna then you get dangerous whole milk part of the reason why pasteurization was mandated int he first place was the rampant cases of food poisoning due to bacteria introduced into the milk and which did better than the ones already in the milk br br think of yeast infections yeast is a natural part of the fauna of human female genitalia but when there is a sudden shift in numbers or a ph shift which kills the yeast you can get an infection of either an over abundance of natural yeast or different strains of yeast br br

congress needs to craft innovative legislation that makes health care more affordable without raising taxes or increasing the deficit it also needs to repeal bad laws that keep health care costs higher than necessary we should remember that hmos did not arise because of free market demand but rather because of government mandates the hmo act of requires all but the smallest employers to offer their employees hmo coverage and the tax code allows businesses c but not individuals c to deduct the cost of health insurance premiums the result is the illogical coupling of employment and health insurance which often leaves the unemployed without needed catastrophic coverage while many in congress are happy to criticize hmos today the public never hears how the present system was imposed upon the american people by federal law as usual government intervention in the private market failed to deliver the promised benefits and caused unintended consequences but congress never blames itself for the problems created by bad laws instead we are told more government c in the form of universal coverage c is the answer but government already is involved in roughly two thirds of all health care spending through medicare medicaid and other programs the following are bills congress should pass to reduce health care costs and leave more money in the pockets of families

an easy solution for this is to lower your existing prices that your cellular customers pay in turn you induce loyalty and have a much happier and much larger customer base to keep in a broken economy the cell phone companies have had consumers by the pair for years with the price point your paying compared to what it really costs them on the bottom line br br it is true they have dumped some of the money back into better carrying technology and other notable positives yet a price reduction should be on the foreground if they want to stay competitive and keep profit shares up in a longterm bubble
